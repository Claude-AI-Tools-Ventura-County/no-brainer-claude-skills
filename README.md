Seven Claude Code skills that catch you at the moment of a decision — and again when you're improving something — and force a short, honest answer you can act on in seconds.

## About

A suite of skills for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) that bring hygiene to the whole life of getting something better — first **deciding well**, then **improving it verifiably**. Each fires at a different moment and forces the response into a short, scannable shape — so a human operator can act fast without missing what matters. The throughline: *make the implicit explicit, lead with the line that survives skimming, and refuse rather than fake it.*

## What you get

- **Faster calls, fewer blind spots.** Every answer leads with the one line that must survive skimming, then adds only the fields that change the decision — no wall of text to wade through.
- **Hidden tradeoffs made explicit.** The cost you're actually paying — the corner you're sacrificing, the assumption you're betting on, the blast radius of the path you picked — gets named out loud *before* you commit.
- **A shared reversibility read.** Every skill speaks one vocabulary — **Easy / Costly / One-way door** — so a cheap two-way door never gets treated like a commitment that's expensive to unwind.
- **Honest signal, not constant alarm.** They stay quiet when a change is small and reversible, and refuse rather than fake a verdict they can't stand behind. Calibration is as much about declining as raising a flag.
- **Improvement you can prove.** Act II turns "make it better" into a metric, an un-gameable oracle, and a baseline, then runs a self-verifying loop that returns a real, numbered win — or a clean "no gain found."

## When to reach for it

- **You're about to commit to a plan or migration** and want to pressure-test the framing before you start — [take-a-step-back](take-a-step-back/SKILL.md).
- **A deadline is squeezing you** and you need to name which of speed, cost, or quality you're actually trading away — [iron-triangle](iron-triangle/SKILL.md).
- **You're eyeing a refactor or schema change** and need to know how far it ripples and how hard it is to undo — [blast-radius](blast-radius/SKILL.md).
- **An agent handed you a wall of options** and you just need the call — [bottom-line](bottom-line/SKILL.md).
- **An agent gave you scattered steps or a verbose completion message** and you need the execution sequence — [linear](linear/SKILL.md).
- **You told an agent "make this faster"** but can't tell whether it actually did — [baseline-spec](baseline-spec/SKILL.md) to define what "better" means, then [auto-improve](auto-improve/SKILL.md) to prove it.

## Act I — Deciding well (decision hygiene)

Four skills that fire around a decision, each answering a different question at a different moment.

| Skill | The operator's question | Its job |
|---|---|---|
| [take-a-step-back](take-a-step-back/SKILL.md) | "Am I making the best decision possible?" | **Frame** — challenge the plan and the problem before committing |
| [iron-triangle](iron-triangle/SKILL.md) | "Which of speed, cost, or quality am I trading away?" | **Price** — make the implicit tradeoff explicit |
| [blast-radius](blast-radius/SKILL.md) | "How big is the path I chose, what breaks, how hard to undo?" | **Size** — measure cost and reversibility of a chosen path |
| [bottom-line](bottom-line/SKILL.md) | "There's too much here — what's the call?" | **Cut** — compress overload and analysis paralysis into a decision |
| [linear](linear/SKILL.md) | "The steps are scattered — what's the execution order?" | **Sequence** — extract and order procedural steps into one top-to-bottom plan |

They **chain** along the life of a decision: **frame** it (should I, and is this the right problem?), **price** the tradeoff (which corner gives?), **size** the chosen path (how big, what breaks?), then **cut** to the bottom line when the analysis balloons, then **sequence** the resulting action into an executable plan. `bottom-line` and `linear` are natural handoffs — one resolves the decision, the other orders the execution. The same situation can touch all five precisely because they answer different questions at different moments.

## Act II — Improving verifiably (measure, then optimize)

Once you've decided to make something concretely better, a second pair carries it from a vibe to a proven result.

| Skill | The operator's question | Its job |
|---|---|---|
| [baseline-spec](baseline-spec/SKILL.md) | "What does 'better' even mean, and how would I know?" | **Define** — turn "make it better" into a metric, oracle, budget, and baseline |
| [auto-improve](auto-improve/SKILL.md) | "Now make it better — provably, not just plausibly." | **Improve** — run a bounded, self-verifying loop, or honestly report no gain |

These **chain** too: **define** the measurable contract, then **improve** against it. The routing is deliberately one-directional — a cold-start request like *"optimize this"* belongs to [baseline-spec](baseline-spec/SKILL.md) (the **definer**), which fires first; [auto-improve](auto-improve/SKILL.md) (the **executor**) defers any undefined request back to it and only runs once a metric, an un-gameable oracle, and a budget already exist. baseline-spec refuses to optimize a goal it can't measure — exactly the Act I instinct of *refuse rather than fake it* — and hands off to auto-improve once the three pillars are locked. auto-improve is the suite's one **executional** skill: instead of emitting a verdict, it runs a ratcheted mutate-measure-keep-or-revert search and returns either a verified, numbered win or a clean "no real improvement found." See its [README](auto-improve/README.md) and [operator FAQ](auto-improve/FAQS.md).

The two acts join end to end: decide *whether and what* (Act I), then *prove the improvement* (Act II).

## What they share

- **Short, structured output.** Every skill leads with the one line that must survive skimming, then adds only the fields that change the call. Drop anything that doesn't; never pad the template. `baseline-spec` follows the same one-shot, scannable shape as the four decision skills; `auto-improve` is the lone exception — it *executes* a loop rather than emitting a verdict, but still leads with an honest headline number.
- **A shared reversibility read.** Where it applies, the skills speak one vocabulary — **Easy / Costly / One-way door** — so a two-way door is treated differently from a commitment that is expensive to unwind. (Iron-triangle's version asks whether a sacrificed corner stays *contained* or *compounds*.)
- **Refuse rather than fake it.** Accurate signal over constant alarm. The decision skills stay quiet when a change is small and reversible; `baseline-spec` refuses to optimize a goal it can't measure; `auto-improve` rejects any "win" that's gamed or lost in the noise. Calibration is as much about declining as raising a flag.

## Calibration — what good output looks like

Good output names the *one* thing that changes the call and ends with a move that reduces uncertainty. Example, from `take-a-step-back`:

> **Decision:** You're about to execute the 3-PR plan doc as written — cherry-picking and sequencing the PRs onto the drifted source branch.
>
> **Step-back check:**
> - **Most fragile assumption:** That the plan doc is still the right path now that the branch has drifted — it was written against a tree that no longer exists.
> - **Alternative frame:** This may not be a "merge the existing PRs" problem at all, but a "re-land the *ideas* as fresh work against current main" problem.
> - **Reversibility:** Costly — once the PRs are cherry-picked and merged in sequence, untangling them from main is real work.
>
> **Do next:** Diff each PR's *intent* against current main and decide per PR — cherry-pick as-is, or re-cut as new work. The plan doc is an input, not a destiny.

What makes it good:
- **One sharp counterpoint, not five.** It names the single fragile assumption instead of listing every possible risk.
- **It challenges the frame**, not just the option — the real question is "follow the plan, or re-cut?", not "how do I cherry-pick cleanly?".
- **Concrete, honest reversibility** — a specific cost, on the shared scale.
- **A do-next that reduces uncertainty** rather than describing it.

The inverse matters just as much: a good skill also knows when *not* to escalate. See `blast-radius`'s small-change example, where the right answer is "ship it, low risk" — calibration is as much about staying quiet as raising a flag.

## Install

These are [Agent Skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) built on the open `SKILL.md` standard, so the same files install across every Claude surface.

### Claude.ai (web) and Claude Desktop

The web app and desktop app share one flow: enable code execution, then upload each skill as its own ZIP.

1. **Enable execution.** Open **Settings > Capabilities** and turn on **Code execution and file creation**. (Available on Free, Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans. On Team/Enterprise, an owner must first enable it under **Organization settings > Skills**.)
2. **Zip each skill folder** — one ZIP per skill, each with a `SKILL.md` at its root. Run from the repo root:
   ```bash
   for s in take-a-step-back iron-triangle blast-radius bottom-line linear baseline-spec auto-improve; do
     (cd "$s" && zip -rX "../$s.zip" . -x '.*')
   done
   ```
3. **Upload.** In Claude, go to **Customize > Skills**, click **+ > + Create skill > Upload a skill**, and select one ZIP. Repeat for each skill.
4. **Turn it on** under **Customize > Skills**.

Uploaded custom skills are private to your account. Install only from sources you trust, and review each `SKILL.md` before enabling.

### Claude Code

Put each skill directory where Claude Code looks for skills — **personal (all projects):** `~/.claude/skills/`, or **project (shared with a repo):** `<project>/.claude/skills/`. Symlink them so a `git pull` keeps them current (run from the repo root):

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.claude/skills"
for s in blast-radius bottom-line linear iron-triangle take-a-step-back baseline-spec auto-improve; do
  ln -s "$PWD/$s" "$HOME/.claude/skills/$s"
done
```

Claude auto-invokes a skill when the request matches its `description`, or you can call it by name. The entry file must be named exactly `SKILL.md` (uppercase) — the loader matches it case-sensitively even on case-insensitive macOS, so a lowercase `skill.md` is silently never discovered.

## Authoring conventions

Lessons baked into these files. Keep them if you add more skills:

- **Valid frontmatter on line 1.** The file must open with `---` and a YAML `name` + `description`, with no prose preamble and no ` ```yaml ` code fence wrapping it — otherwise the skill silently fails to load and never appears.
- **Entry file must be `SKILL.md`, exact case.** The loader matches it case-sensitively even on case-insensitive macOS, so a lowercase `skill.md` is silently skipped — and watch for git hiding a case-only rename when `core.ignorecase` is true.
- **ASCII punctuation.** Straight quotes and regular hyphens. Curly quotes and non-breaking hyphens (`‑`) look identical but break grep, copy, and matching. Em-dashes are fine.
- **Triggers live in the `description`.** That is the surface Claude matches against — keep it concrete and observable ("about to recommend a migration"), never circular ("fire when the change is major", which the skill can only know *after* running).
- **Examples calibrate behavior.** Include at least one counter-example where the skill correctly does *not* escalate — a small change, a cheap reversible call — or it will skew toward alarm.
- **Brevity is the product.** Each skill's output should be just enough meat that a human operator will actually read it.
